Thankyou ICIT Collage for organizing this contest. I really enjoy creating this prject
Here are most details about this project

In this projct I used font-awesome libery for icon and I only used pure HTML and CSS for 
creating project. 

1. I sepereate my website mainly into 3 sections. 
* header
* main 
* footer 

In the header section I add navbar section and also categories it into different sections
In the main section all the content are there and it simple in design because I want to 
make it easy access with faster speed. 
In the footer section I add copyright bar just for nice look 

Talking about CSS I give name for all div. 

The main problem my web design solve is: 
1. Userfriendly interface 
2. easy to use 
3. everything in one layout

that's it.
